Quine-McCluskey Program - Python 3 Code
Simplify Boolean expressions effortlessly with the Quine-McCluskey Method using this Python program. 
Ideal for Logic Design, the code takes user inputs for variables (minterms or don't care terms) and applies the Quine-McCluskey method along with Petrickâ€™s method to streamline Boolean expressions.

Input Processing:
Prompt users for variables, minterms, and don't cares, creating a sorted list called minterms.

Table Creation and Prime Implicant Search:
Initiate variables, compare minterms, and generate prime implicants iteratively.

Processing Essential Prime Implicants:
Identify, remove, and apply Petrick's method if necessary, storing results in final_result list.

Display Final Result:
Sequentially display the final result.
